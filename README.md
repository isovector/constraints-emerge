## Synopsis

```haskell
{-# LANGUAGE ConstraintKinds     #-}
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts    #-}
{-# LANGUAGE ScopedTypeVariables #-}
{-# LANGUAGE TypeApplications    #-}
{-# OPTIONS_GHC -fplugin=Data.Constraint.Emerge.Plugin #-}

module Test where

import Data.Constraint.Emerge

showAnything :: forall c. Emerge (Show c) => c -> String
showAnything c =
  case emerge @(Show c) of
    Just Dict -> show c
    Nothing -> "<<unshowable>>"


showBool = showAnything True  -- "True"
showId   = showAnything id    -- "<<unshowable>>"
```


## Known Bugs

* `constraints-emerge` will generate type-equality dictionaries any types (even
    ones that aren't equal :scream: :scream: :scream:)
* It fails to provide `Emerge c` dictionaries at runtime.
* The generated error messages mention mangled type variables; it would be cool
    if they didn't.

If someone wants to pick it up from here, thatâ€™d be great!
